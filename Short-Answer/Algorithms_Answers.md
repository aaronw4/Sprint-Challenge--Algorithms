#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)The number of operations will increase at the same rate as the value of n. Therefore, the run time will be O(n)


b)The number of operations here increases slower than the value of n. It increase near the square root of n. Therefore the run time is O(sqrt n)


c)This recursine will occur at the same number of times as is the value of bunnies. Therefore the run time is linear or O(n).
